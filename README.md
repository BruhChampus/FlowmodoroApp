# FlowmodoroApp
Idea taken from the Archer Newton channel from the video "The Technique Better than Pomodoro - Flowmodoro"

The application is a timer that will help you focus on the task. Time goes on until you press the "break" button, after which the application counts how many minutes of the break you have to allocate (depending on those minutes how much you studied) and allocates you a break. Session data is stored in a database on your phone.


## Tech stack
* Koin for dependency injection
* Jetpack navigation for navigating between fragments
* Room Database for saving data
* Coroutines for asynchronous operations
* ViewModel and Livedata for implementation MVVM pattern
